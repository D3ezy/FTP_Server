Answers to HW Questions:
1. Consider the security of the data of FTP and the commands. Good or bad? Is BitTorrent better or worse? Why? What about SFTP? Is it the way that it is implemented or are there considerations because of how the protocol works? (Look up the basics of SFTP and BitTorrent) 

2. Do you think that someone could hack into your FTP server? Why or why not? Through what methods? 

3. EXTRA CREDIT: Critique how FTP solves the problem of file transfer â€“ what is good? What is bad? What is weird? 

4. EXTRA CREDIT: How hard would it be to make FTP use one channel instead of two?
